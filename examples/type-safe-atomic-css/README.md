# Type-Safe Atomic CSS

This is an example implementation of the principles that are written about in my blog post [here]("https://adamaho.me/writing/type-safe-atomic-css).

## Development

If you wish to play around, use the following steps to get going:

1. Install pnpm if you havent already

```
npm install -g pnpm
```

2. Run the dev server

```
pnpm dev
```

3. Observe all of the defined class names in the `styles/utilities` folder.
